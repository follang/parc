# Contributor Workflow

This chapter records a practical workflow for changing `parc` safely.

## Smallest-reproducer rule

When fixing or extending the parser, start with the smallest input that demonstrates the issue.

That input should usually be one of:

- a direct `parse::*` snippet
- a reftest file
- a preprocessed snapshot

This keeps parser work focused.

## Recommended change sequence

1. reproduce the issue with the smallest possible input
2. decide whether the right test layer is `parse_api`, reftest, or full-app style
3. inspect the AST or failure position with `Printer` or structured errors
4. patch the relevant parser module
5. rerun the focused tests
6. only then widen out to broader test coverage

## Choosing the right test layer

Use `parse_api` tests when:

- the bug is a simple grammar acceptance issue
- you only need a success/failure assertion

Use reftests when:

- tree shape matters
- printer output is the clearest regression oracle

Use preprocessed or full-app style fixtures when:

- includes or macro expansion are part of the problem
- driver behavior matters

## Grammar-oriented debugging

A good parser debugging loop is:

1. isolate the failing syntax
2. parse with the right flavor
3. inspect the closest AST shape that already works
4. patch the grammar in the most local parser file possible

This is usually better than broad speculative rewrites.

## AST changes

If you add or change an AST node, review the corresponding surfaces too:

- visitor hooks in `visit`
- printer behavior in `print`
- any book examples that describe the shape
- reftest expectations if printer output changed

## Documentation changes

If a syntax family becomes better supported, update the book at the same time.
The important places are usually:

- flavor/extension guidance
- unsupported cases
- workflows
- AST or visitor examples

That keeps the book aligned with the real parser contract.

## Boundary rule

When changing `parc`, keep the ownership split explicit:

- `parc` owns preprocessing, parsing, extraction, and source artifacts
- `parc` does not own link evidence or Rust lowering
- do not document parser internals as if they were a shared ABI for the rest of
  the pipeline

If a change makes the source artifact richer, document the richer source
meaning directly instead of hinting that downstream crates depend on `parc`
library internals.

## Maintenance rule

The maintenance bar is simple:

1. add or tighten the smallest useful test first
2. keep public contract docs and examples in the same patch
3. prefer deleting stale workflow language over preserving it for history
4. do not keep dead compatibility stories in the book
